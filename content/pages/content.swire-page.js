        "In association with Sierra Five myself and a colleague created the old Taikoo Sugar factory and sugar van for use in the final production of Taikoo Sugar's internal video. The idea was to re-create the original Taikoo Sugar building that no longer exists in 3D so that it could be used to transition into the new factory. We modelled and textured the entire building so it was production ready and appeared as though it had been filmed years ago. We created the building in colour as seen above but the final image was in black and white.",
        "We also modelled and textured one of the original sugar vans used decades ago, which was animated in the final film driving around the old factory building.",
        "You can see some clips from the video including the part we worked on below. My work appears at 0:42:"
