        "In association with Framestore myself and a colleague created multiple hero assets from concept art to be used on the second season of the TV series Mars created for National Geographic. Mars is a documentary and hard science fiction television series. It blends elements of real interviews with a fictional story. I had to follow strict model and labelling guidelines as specified by Framestore while creating each element. All models had to be high detailed subdivision models with no poly limit."
