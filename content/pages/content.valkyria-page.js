        "Valkyria is Europe’s longest Dive Coaster, a roller coaster with a vertical drop of nearly 50 metres. Just as you’re about to go over the edge, the ride pauses and you plunge vertically into an underground tunnel at a speed of 105 kph. The Coaster is situated within the Myths and Legend area of Liseberg Theme Park in Sweden.",
        "Along with Quarry Fold Studio I created concept material based around the theming of Norse mythology to promote Valkyria. I also created multiple ride animations, one in situ within Liseberg and one in a fantasy environment that fitted within the ride theme. The work created by myself was used in Print, TV and web."
